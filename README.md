Lottery App
A simple Flutter app that simulates a lottery draw. Users can click the refresh button to generate a random number between 0 and 5. If the generated number matches the winning number (4 in this case), the user wins and sees a green overlay with a congratulatory message. Otherwise, a red overlay appears, indicating that it's not a winning number.

Features:
Random Number Generation: The app utilizes Dart's random library to generate random numbers.

Visual Feedback: Users receive immediate visual feedback on whether they won or lost the lottery.
